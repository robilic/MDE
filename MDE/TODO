Where I left off last:
    Finish wiring up sides/lines properties panels
    Started on grid.
    Grid doesn't get along with scaling
    Wire grid drop-down to gridSize variable
    Fix off-by-one bug with grid when in negative viewport coordinates

Refactoring:
    SelectedObject needs to be a more complex variable. Indicating type as well as ID. isSelected as well?
    Move statement 'selectedObject = x' to 'selectObject(x)' function
    Change thing[id].value = foo to changeThing(id, value)
    Functions for window coords -> map coords

Next up:

 Colorize things according to DEU header files
 Thing detail window
 Vertex detail window
 Sprite browser
 Floor/ceiling browser
 Wall texture browser
 Draw grid

 Load wall textures (encoded like sprites)
 Make functions for seeking/reading WAD files

 Implement sectors: hit detection, panels, highlights
 
 Check if elements to draw are in the viewport or not
 Implement buckets for verts etc
 Show x/y for mouse cursor
 Implement the viewport thumbnail
 Limit scrolling to 65,536 x 65,536
 Limit maps to +/- 10,000 instead of 32768?
 Pinch to zoom?
