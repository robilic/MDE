+ Started on grid.
+ Grid doesn't get along with scaling
+ Fix off-by-one bug with grid when in negative viewport coordinates
+ Check if elements to draw are in the viewport or not

Where I left off last:
    Fix properties panel when resizing
    Sync Scale drop down on startup
    Finish wiring up sides/lines properties panels
    Wire grid drop-down to gridSize variable

Refactoring:
    Does SelectedObject need to be a more complex variable. Indicating type as well as ID. isSelected?
    Move statement 'selectedObject = x' to 'selectObject(x)' function
    Change thing[id].value = foo to changeThing(id, value)
    Functions for window coords -> map coords
        (vertexes[i].x-viewportX)/z
        screenCoordX(vertexes[i].x)
        return (x - viewportX)/z
Next up:

 Colorize things according to DEU header files
 Thing detail window
 Vertex detail window
 Sprite browser
 Floor/ceiling browser
 Wall texture browser
 Draw grid

 Load wall textures (encoded like sprites)
 Make functions for seeking/reading WAD files

 Implement sectors: hit detection, panels, highlights
 
 Implement buckets for verts etc
 Show x/y for mouse cursor
 Implement the viewport thumbnail
 Limit scrolling to 65,536 x 65,536
 Limit maps to +/- 10,000 instead of 32768?
 Pinch to zoom?

Hotkeys:
 Zoom
