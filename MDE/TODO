Where I left off last:
    Linked vertexes to property panels, works on highlight. Should update on move.

Refactoring:
    SelectedObject needs to be a more complex variable. Indicating type as well as ID. isSelected as well?
    Move statement 'selectedObject = x' to 'selectObject(x)' function
    Change thing[id].value = foo to changeThing(id, value)
